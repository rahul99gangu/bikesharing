### Summary 

A bicycle-sharing system is a service in which people can rent a bicycle for short-time period. The bike share system is now more popular for people in living or working in the metropolis downtowns not only in United States, but also around the world. The bike share is a trend and an opportunity that local city governments want to support and to invite business organizations to do business because the bike share brings to many good benefits such as: to reduce Carbon Dioxin, traffic, and accident as well as  to promote public health. Citi bike, one of bicycle share service in New York city, is a successful running business in the Great Manhattan Downtown New York. We will use the data of Citi bike in New York to analyze if it is good to open a bike share in Des Moines downtown, Iowa. We will look in the gender diversity to do our data analysis.

### Introduction

1.	Let us Look at the numbers. New York population is about 8.4 million, male is about 4.0 million, and female is about 4.4 million. Income age (18-65) is about 5.5 million While Des Moines is much less in population about 0.2 million, male and female are respectively about 0.1 million and 0.1 million. And income age (18-65) is about 0.14 million. These numbers are so different to do a comparation between two cities because New York is a major metropolis city in the world and Des Moines is a regular city like other cities in the United States

2.	However, if we look at the percent numbers, then we find out that both cities are the same characters of population, genders, and income age. So, it should be a good candidate city for the bike share business.

The total numbers of bike share rides were checked out from station is 2.3 million while the male gender check-out ratio is 65.28% (1.5 million) and the female is 25% (0.5 million). We should disregard the unknown gender for now because we are only considered male and female genders. We need to break these numbers down because New York is a major tourist spot. 

1. Customer type: Short-term customers. They can be tourist people or local people who does not need a long-term membership. The Customers by Genders Pie chart has about 0.44 million. It is about one sixth of the total rides. However, this number may not consistent month to month because it depends on tourist seasons.

2. Subscriber type: Long-term customers. They are local people who need to often use the bike share service. We need to investigate this type breakdown because it is truly customer type of the business. The Subscribers by Genders Pie chart has about 1.9 million subscribers. It is about five sixth of the total rides. The percent of male rides is 72.23% and female is 25.98%. If we convert the percent numbers for Moines, then 77,063 possible rides are for male gender, 28,619 possible rides are for female gender and total possible rides is 105,682. This number compare to Population of Des Moines is about 50% or 1 in 2 people might use the service one in a month.

We can see clearly that both genders and age are actively to use the bike share service in the great Manhattan downtown. The downtown is a place attractive all businesses and services as well as landmarks. It is the place for peopleâ€™s workplaces and visit. If we apply this model to Des Moines city, the bike stations need to be placed in the downtown where people work, and people visit as well as restaurant or rails metro.
